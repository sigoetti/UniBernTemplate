# UniBernTemplate

A LateX template for my course essays at the University of Bern. It's easier this way to do the several bibliography styles. Currently this templates contains my adaption of the dcu.bst file for Religionswissenschaft and my own DAI-like file for Prähistorische Archäologie.

Compiling: Use PDFLateX and BibteX to compile
